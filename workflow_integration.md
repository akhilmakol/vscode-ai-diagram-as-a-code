## 📝 VS Code 1.100+ New Features

VS Code 1.100+ introduces powerful new features for customizing AI interactions through Markdown-based files:

### 📄 Instruction Files (`.instructions.md`)

Instruction files let you define common guidelines and context that can be applied to specific files or chat requests.

**✨ Example Structure:**

```markdown
# Diagram Style Guide Instructions

## Context
This repository uses a microservices architecture with 8 core services. 
We follow C4 model conventions for all architecture documentation.

## Style Guidelines
- Use consistent color palette: primary (#5a67d8), secondary (#c3dafe)
- All diagrams must include a title and description
- Group related services by domain using subgraphs
- Maintain left-to-right flow for improved readability

## Required Components
- Authentication Service
- User Service
- Product Catalog
- Order Processing
- Payment Gateway
```

**🛠️ Apply Instructions to Files:**

Configure VS Code settings to automatically apply instructions to specific files:

```json
// settings.json
{
  "chat.instructionFilesPattern": {
    "**/*.mmd": ["**/diagram-style-guide.instructions.md"],
    "**/architecture/**": ["**/architecture-guide.instructions.md"]
  }
}
```

> 💡 **Pro tip:** Store team instruction files in `.vscode/instructions/` folder for automatic sharing with teammates

### 📄 Prompt Files (`.prompt.md`)

Prompt files allow you to create reusable, standalone chat requests that can be executed on demand.

**✨ Example Structure:**

```markdown
---
mode: agent
tools:
  - file_search
  - read_file
  - semantic_search
  - mermaid-diagram-validator
  - mermaid-diagram-preview
---

# Generate Component Diagram

Create a component diagram for our system that shows:

1. All microservices from the `src/services` directory
2. Their relationships and dependencies
3. External systems and data stores

The diagram should use Mermaid flowchart syntax with left-to-right orientation.
```

**🚀 Running Prompt Files:**

1. Command Palette: Use "Chat: Run Prompt File" command
2. Explorer: Right-click on a `.prompt.md` file
3. Terminal: `code --chat "run-prompt-file path/to/file.prompt.md"`

> 📝 **Note:** For more detailed information on using these new file types, see the [Instruction and Prompt Files Guide](instruction_prompt_files_guide.md)

## 🤖 Automating Diagram Updates with Code Changes

### 🔄 Pre-Commit Hook for Diagram Updates

Create a Git pre-commit hook that:

1. Identifies modified code files
2. Uses VS Code's AI features to update related diagrams
3. Commits the updated diagrams along with the code changes

**✨ Example Using VS Code 1.100+ Prompt Files** *(place in `.git/hooks/pre-commit`):*

```bash
#!/bin/zsh
# Get list of modified files
modified_files=$(git diff --cached --name-only)

# Check if any architectural components were modified
if echo "$modified_files" | grep -q "src/core/" || echo "$modified_files" | grep -q "architecture/"; then
  echo "Core architecture files modified. Updating architecture diagrams..."
  
  # Use VS Code prompt file to update diagrams
  code --chat "run-prompt-file .vscode/prompts/update-architecture-diagram.prompt.md" --args "component=core"
  
  # Add updated diagram files to the commit
  git add docs/diagrams/*.md
fi
```

**Alternative with Traditional Chat Command** *(if not using prompt files yet):*

```bash
#!/bin/zsh
# Get list of modified files
modified_files=$(git diff --cached --name-only)

# Check if any architectural components were modified
if echo "$modified_files" | grep -q "src/core/" || echo "$modified_files" | grep -q "architecture/"; then
  echo "Core architecture files modified. Updating architecture diagrams..."
  # Use VS Code CLI to trigger diagram update using a reusable prompt
  code --execute-command "chat.openChat" --args "Update architecture diagrams based on changes to core components"
  
  # Add updated diagram files to the commit
  git add docs/diagrams/*.md
fi
```

> 💡 **Pro tip**: Make the pre-commit hook executable with `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`

### 🚀 Using GitHub Actions for Diagram Generation

Create a GitHub Action workflow to automatically generate and update diagrams when code changes:

**✨ Modern Approach with VS Code 1.100+ Prompt Files:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/update-diagrams.yml
name: Update System Diagrams

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
    paths:
      - 'src/core/**'
      - 'architecture/**'
      - 'config/**'

jobs:
  update-diagrams:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup VS Code
        uses: actions/setup-vscode@v1
      
      - name: Update Architecture Diagrams
        run: |
          # Run the specific prompt file with variable arguments
          code --chat "run-prompt-file .vscode/prompts/generate-architecture-diagram.prompt.md" \
            --args "source=src/core services=8 style=detailed"
          
      - name: Commit updated diagrams
        run: |
          git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
          git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
          git add docs/diagrams/*.md
          git commit -m "Update diagrams based on code changes" || echo "No changes to commit"
          git push
```

**Alternative Approach (Traditional Chat Command):**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/update-diagrams.yml
name: Update System Diagrams

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
    paths:
      - 'src/core/**'
      - 'architecture/**'
      - 'config/**'

jobs:
  update-diagrams:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup VS Code
        uses: actions/setup-vscode@v1
      
      - name: Update Architecture Diagrams
        run: |
          code --execute-command "chat.openChat" --args "Generate updated architecture diagrams based on the current code structure in src/core/"
          
      - name: Commit updated diagrams
        run: |
          git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
          git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
          git add docs/diagrams/*.md
          git commit -m "Update diagrams based on code changes" || echo "No changes to commit"
          git push
```

## 📚 Integrating with Documentation Systems

### 📄 Automated Documentation with MkDocs

Set up a workflow that automatically updates diagrams and integrates them with MkDocs:

**✨ Modern Approach with VS Code 1.100+ Prompt Files:**

```bash
#!/bin/zsh
# Update diagrams before building documentation
echo "Updating diagrams for documentation..."

# For each system component, use the appropriate diagram prompt file
components=("user-service" "product-service" "order-service")

for component in "${components[@]}"; do
  # Run specific prompt file with component variable
  code --chat "run-prompt-file .vscode/prompts/generate-component-doc.prompt.md" \
    --args "component=$component" > docs/architecture/$component.md
done

# Continue with documentation build
mkdocs build
```

**Alternative Approach (Traditional Chat Command):**

```bash
#!/bin/zsh
# Update diagrams before building documentation
echo "Updating diagrams for documentation..."

# For each system component, use the appropriate diagram generation prompt
components=("user-service" "product-service" "order-service")

for component in "${components[@]}"; do
  code --execute-command "chat.openChat" --args "Generate updated diagram for $component based on current code" > docs/architecture/$component.md
done

# Continue with documentation build
mkdocs build
```

> 📝 **Note**: This script can be added to your `package.json` scripts or run as a pre-build step in your CI pipeline

### 📝 Setup VS Code Markdown-Based Files for Documentation

Create instruction and prompt files for documentation consistency:

**1. Create an instruction file for documentation consistency:**

```markdown
# Documentation Diagram Instructions

## Context
- Our documentation uses a standardized format
- Diagrams should match our brand guidelines
- All diagrams should be clearly labeled and captioned

## Style Guidelines
- Use preset color scheme: main (#6366F1), secondary (#A5B4FC), highlight (#EF4444)
- Include diagram title as H2 heading above the diagram
- Add source information in a caption below the diagram
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across all diagrams

## Required Elements
- Diagram title
- Component labels
- Flow direction indicators
- Legend (for complex diagrams)
- Timestamp of last update
```

**2. Create a prompt file for generating documentation diagrams:**

```markdown
---
mode: agent
tools:
  - read_file
  - semantic_search
  - mermaid-diagram-validator
  - mermaid-diagram-preview
variables:
  component: "service-name"
  format: "component"
---

# Generate {{format}} Diagram for {{component}}

Create a comprehensive {{format}} diagram for the {{component}} that:

1. Shows the internal structure of the component
2. Includes all important classes and interfaces
3. Highlights public APIs and interaction points
4. Uses our standard documentation style conventions

The output should be in proper Mermaid syntax and ready to insert into our documentation.
```

### 🔄 Integrating with Confluence or SharePoint

Create automation scripts to update diagrams and push them to Confluence or SharePoint:

**✨ Modern Approach with VS Code 1.100+ Prompt Files:**

```bash
#!/bin/zsh
# Generate updated diagrams using prompt file
code --chat "run-prompt-file .vscode/prompts/generate-architecture-diagram.prompt.md" \
  --args "format=both output=docs/diagrams/architecture"

# Upload to Confluence using REST API
curl -u $USERNAME:$API_TOKEN -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "type": "page",
    "title": "System Architecture",
    "space": {"key": "PROJ"},
    "body": {
      "storage": {
        "value": "'"$(cat docs/diagrams/architecture.md)"'",
        "representation": "wiki"
      }
    }
  }' \
  https://your-confluence.atlassian.net/rest/api/content/12345
```

**Alternative Approach (Traditional Chat Command):**

```bash
#!/bin/zsh
# Generate updated diagrams
code --execute-command "chat.openChat" --args "Generate current architecture diagram in both Mermaid and PNG formats"

# Upload to Confluence using REST API
curl -u $USERNAME:$API_TOKEN -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "type": "page",
    "title": "System Architecture",
    "space": {"key": "PROJ"},
    "body": {
      "storage": {
        "value": "'"$(cat docs/diagrams/architecture.md)"'",
        "representation": "wiki"
      }
    }
  }' \
  https://your-confluence.atlassian.net/rest/api/content/12345
```

## 🏗️ Diagram-Driven Development

### 📝 Setting Up a Diagram-First Workflow

**✨ Using VS Code 1.100+ Prompt Files:**

Create a structured approach using prompt files for diagram-driven development:

**Step 1: Create diagram definition prompt files:**

```markdown
---
mode: agent
tools:
  - mermaid-diagram-validator
  - mermaid-diagram-preview
---

# Create Component Definition Diagram

Design a comprehensive component diagram for a new service that:

1. Shows the main functionalities as separate components
2. Defines clear interfaces between components
3. Identifies dependencies on other services
4. Specifies data flow between components

The output should be in Mermaid syntax and follow our architecture guidelines.
```

**Step 2: Create code generation prompt files based on diagrams:**

```markdown
---
mode: agent
tools:
  - read_file
  - file_search
  - create_file
---

# Generate Code from Component Diagram

Using the diagram at {{diagram_path}}, generate:

1. Skeleton code for each component shown
2. Interface definitions for all connection points
3. Base implementation classes
4. Configuration files as needed

Follow our code style guidelines and create files in the appropriate project structure.
```

**Step 3: Create test generation prompt files:**

```markdown
---
mode: agent
tools:
  - read_file
  - create_file
---

# Generate Tests from Component Diagram

Analyze the component diagram at {{diagram_path}} and create:

1. Unit test skeletons for each component
2. Integration test scenarios for component interactions
3. Mock implementations for external dependencies
4. Test configuration files

Tests should follow our standard testing patterns and naming conventions.
```

**Alternative Approach with VS Code Tasks:**

Create VS Code tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json` that support diagram-driven development:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Create Component from Diagram",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "code --execute-command \"chat.openChat\" --args \"Generate a code skeleton from the component diagram at ${file}\"",
      "problemMatcher": []
    },
    {
      "label": "Update Diagram Based on Code Changes",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "code --execute-command \"chat.openChat\" --args \"Update the diagram at ${relativeFile} based on code changes in ${workspaceFolder}/src/${fileBasenameNoExtension}\"",
      "problemMatcher": []
    },
    {
      "label": "Generate Tests from Diagram",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "code --execute-command \"chat.openChat\" --args \"Generate unit tests for the component described in the diagram at ${file}\"",
      "problemMatcher": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### 👁️ Using Diagrams for Code Reviews

**✨ Create a Prompt File for PR Reviews:**

```markdown
---
mode: agent
tools:
  - get_changed_files
  - read_file
  - mermaid-diagram-validator
  - mermaid-diagram-preview
---

# Generate PR Diagram Review

Create a visual summary of the changes in this PR by:

1. Analyzing the modified files
2. Generating a before/after architecture diagram showing the impact
3. Highlighting:
   - New components or relationships
   - Modified interfaces
   - Potential impact areas not directly modified
   - Any architectural concerns or improvements

Format the output as a markdown comment that can be posted to a GitHub PR.
```

**Integrate with PR Review Workflow:**

Create a GitHub Action to auto-generate diagram reviews:

```yaml
name: Diagram Review for PRs

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  diagram-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Setup VS Code
        uses: actions/setup-vscode@v1
      
      - name: Generate Diagram Review
        run: |
          code --chat "run-prompt-file .github/review-templates/diagram-review.prompt.md" > review.md
      
      - name: Post Review Comment
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          script: |
            const fs = require('fs');
            const review = fs.readFileSync('review.md', 'utf8');
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: review
            });
```

## 👥 Team Collaboration around Diagrams

### 📚 Shared Instruction and Prompt Library

**✨ Modern Approach with VS Code 1.100+ Files:**

Organize shared instruction and prompt files in your project repository:

```text
project/
├── .vscode/
│   ├── instructions/
│   │   ├── diagram-standards.instructions.md
│   │   ├── architecture-style.instructions.md
│   │   └── documentation-guidelines.instructions.md
│   └── prompts/
│       ├── generate-component-diagram.prompt.md
│       ├── update-sequence-diagram.prompt.md
│       ├── review-architecture.prompt.md
│       └── README.md
```

**Example Team-Wide Instruction File:**

```markdown
# Team Architecture Diagram Instructions

## Project Context
- Our system follows a hexagonal architecture pattern
- We use event-driven communication between bounded contexts
- External integrations use standard REST or GraphQL interfaces

## Style Guidelines
- Core domain components: #4f46e5
- Supporting domains: #7c3aed
- Infrastructure components: #1e40af
- External systems: #9ca3af
- Data stores: #047857

## Required Elements
- Component boundaries clearly marked
- Interface definitions at boundaries
- Directionality of dependencies
- Data flow indicators
- Version information in diagram title
```

**Team-Wide Prompt File for Component Creation:**

```markdown
---
mode: agent
tools:
  - file_search
  - read_file
  - create_file
variables:
  component: ""
  domain: ""
---

# Generate {{domain}} {{component}} Component

Create a new component for the {{domain}} domain named {{component}} that:

1. Follows our hexagonal architecture pattern
2. Includes appropriate ports and adapters
3. Implements our standard error handling
4. Provides proper instrumentation hooks
5. Contains necessary test scaffolding

Include both implementation code and component diagram.
```

**Alternative Approach (Traditional Reusable Prompts):**

Create a team-wide library of reusable prompts stored in version control:

```text
project/
├── .vscode/
│   └── prompts/
│       ├── architecture-diagrams.json
│       ├── sequence-diagrams.json
│       ├── class-diagrams.json
│       └── README.md
```

Create a simple script to import these prompts into VS Code:

```bash
#!/bin/zsh
# Import team prompts into VS Code settings
PROMPTS_DIR=".vscode/prompts"
SETTINGS_FILE="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json"

# Read each prompt file
for prompt_file in "$PROMPTS_DIR"/*.json; do
  # Merge prompts into settings file
  jq -s '.[0].chat.reusablePrompts += (.[1].prompts)' "$SETTINGS_FILE" "$prompt_file" > temp.json
  mv temp.json "$SETTINGS_FILE"
done

echo "Team prompts imported successfully!"
```

### 🔍 Diagram Review Workflow

**✨ Using VS Code 1.100+ Prompt Files for Reviews:**

Create a standardized prompt file for diagram reviews:

```markdown
---
mode: agent
tools:
  - read_file
  - semantic_search
variables:
  diagram_path: ""
  architecture_principles_path: ".vscode/instructions/architecture-principles.instructions.md"
---

# Review Architecture Diagram

Review the diagram at {{diagram_path}} using the principles in {{architecture_principles_path}}:

1. Check adherence to our architectural principles:
   - Microservices boundaries properly defined
   - Authentication and authorization correctly applied
   - Appropriate use of caching
   - Proper error handling shown

2. Identify potential issues:
   - Single points of failure
   - Scalability bottlenecks
   - Missing security controls
   - Unclear responsibility boundaries

3. Validate implementation feasibility:
   - Technology stack compatibility
   - Deployment complexity
   - Maintenance considerations
   - Performance implications

Provide specific, actionable feedback organized by component.
```

**Create a Structured Review Process:**

1. Scheduled team diagram reviews using `.instructions.md` files for consistency
2. Automated checklist generation from prompt files
3. Capture feedback in standardized format
4. Track review history alongside diagrams in version control

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Integration

### 🔎 Diagram Validation in CI/CD

**✨ Modern Approach with VS Code 1.100+ Prompt Files:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/validate-diagrams.yml
name: Validate Architecture Diagrams

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - 'src/**'
      - 'docs/diagrams/**'

jobs:
  validate-diagrams:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup VS Code
        uses: actions/setup-vscode@v1
      
      - name: Check Diagram Consistency
        run: |
          # Use a specific prompt file for validation
          code --chat "run-prompt-file .github/actions/validate-architecture.prompt.md" > validation-report.md
          
          # Check if report contains inconsistencies
          if grep -q "inconsistency detected" validation-report.md; then
            echo "::error::Diagrams are inconsistent with code structure"
            cat validation-report.md
            exit 1
          fi
```

**Example Validation Prompt File:**

```markdown
---
mode: agent
tools:
  - file_search
  - read_file
  - semantic_search
---

# Validate Architecture Diagrams

Compare the diagrams in docs/diagrams/ with the actual code structure in src/:

1. For each component in the diagrams, verify it exists in the codebase
2. Check that all relationships shown in diagrams are reflected in the code
3. Identify components in the code that are missing from the diagrams
4. Detect any structural inconsistencies between diagrams and code

Format the output as a validation report with:
- Summary of findings
- List of inconsistencies (component name, diagram location, code location)
- Severity rating for each issue (minor, major, critical)
- Recommendations for resolution

If any inconsistencies are found, include the phrase "inconsistency detected" in the output.
```

**Alternative Approach (Traditional Chat Command):**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/validate-diagrams.yml
name: Validate Architecture Diagrams

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - 'src/**'
      - 'docs/diagrams/**'

jobs:
  validate-diagrams:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Check Diagram Consistency
        run: |
          # This is conceptual - actual implementation would use VS Code CLI
          code --execute-command "chat.openChat" --args "Validate that the diagrams in docs/diagrams/ accurately represent the code structure in src/" > validation-report.md
          
          # Check if report contains inconsistencies
          if grep -q "inconsistency detected" validation-report.md; then
            echo "::error::Diagrams are inconsistent with code structure"
            cat validation-report.md
            exit 1
          fi
```

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./site
```

**Example Diagram Generation Prompt File:**

```markdown
---
mode: agent
tools:
  - file_search
  - read_file
  - semantic_search
---

# Generate System Context Diagram

Create a comprehensive system context diagram that:

1. Shows our system as a central component
2. Identifies all users and user types
3. Includes all external systems and third-party integrations
4. Displays key data flows between entities
5. Labels all connections with interaction types

The diagram should use the Mermaid flowchart syntax with our standard styling and follow the C4 model convention for context diagrams.

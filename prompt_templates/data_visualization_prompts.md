# üìä Data Visualization Template Prompts

> *A collection of reusable prompts for creating data visualizations in Mermaid syntax*

---

This file contains reusable prompts for creating pie charts, XY charts, and other data visualizations in Mermaid syntax. Copy these prompts and add them to your VS Code Reusable Prompts collection.

## Basic Pie Chart

```
Create a Mermaid pie chart showing the distribution of [data category].
Include these segments and their values: [list segments and values].
Add a descriptive title. Use a color scheme that distinguishes segments clearly.
Include a brief caption explaining what the chart represents.
```

## Project Budget Allocation Pie Chart

```
Generate a Mermaid pie chart showing budget allocation for a [project type] project.
Include these budget categories and their percentages: [list categories and percentages].
Make sure percentages sum to 100%. Add a title "Budget Allocation - [Project Name]".
Use colors that indicate priority or category type.
```

## Market Share Pie Chart

```
Create a Mermaid pie chart showing market share for [industry/product] in [timeframe].
Include these competitors and their market share percentages: [list companies and percentages].
Add a title and make sure percentages sum to 100%. Highlight the largest segment.
Include a caption with the data source.
```

## Resource Utilization Pie Chart

```
Generate a Mermaid pie chart showing resource utilization for [team/system].
Include these categories and their utilization percentages: [list categories and percentages].
Use colors that indicate efficiency levels (e.g., green for optimal, yellow for moderate, 
red for high utilization). Add a title that clearly explains what is being measured.
```

## Basic XY Chart

```
Create a Mermaid XY chart showing [metric] over [timeframe].
Include these data points: [list x,y coordinates].
Label the x-axis "[x-axis label]" and y-axis "[y-axis label]".
Add a title that clearly explains the data being visualized.
Include a trend line if appropriate.
```

## Performance Metrics XY Chart

```
Generate a Mermaid XY chart showing [performance metric] over [timeframe].
Include data points for each period: [list periods and values].
Label the x-axis "Time Period" and y-axis "[Metric Name] ([unit])".
Add a title "[Metric Name] Trends". Include benchmark or target values as reference lines.
```

## Comparison XY Chart

```
Create a Mermaid XY chart comparing [metric] between [entity A] and [entity B]
over [timeframe]. Include data points for each entity: [list points for both].
Label the axes appropriately. Use different colors for each entity.
Add a legend to identify each entity. Include a title explaining the comparison.
```

## Growth Projection XY Chart

```
Generate a Mermaid XY chart showing actual and projected [metric] for [entity]
from [start period] to [end period]. Mark the current point where actual data
transitions to projections. Include these data points: [list points].
Use different line styles or colors for actual vs projected data.
Add annotations explaining key inflection points or assumptions.
```

## Quadrant Chart

```
Create a Mermaid quadrant chart for analyzing [entities] based on [x-axis factor]
and [y-axis factor]. Label the quadrants: [top-right label], [top-left label],
[bottom-right label], [bottom-left label]. Include these data points: [list entities
with x,y coordinates]. Label each point. Add a title explaining the analysis.
```

## Product Portfolio Quadrant Chart

```
Generate a Mermaid quadrant chart for a product portfolio analysis.
X-axis should represent "Market Growth" (low to high), and Y-axis should 
represent "Market Share" (low to high). Label the quadrants: Stars (top-right),
Question Marks (top-left), Cash Cows (bottom-right), and Dogs (bottom-left).
Include these products with their positions: [list products with x,y coordinates].
Add a title "Product Portfolio Analysis" and briefly explain quadrant meanings.
```

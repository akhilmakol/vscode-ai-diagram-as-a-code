## üõ†Ô∏è Using These Prompts

### Option 1: With GitHub Copilot Chat

1. Copy the prompt of your choice
2. Open GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code
3. Paste the prompt and customize the placeholders in [brackets]
4. Use the generated SVG in your project

### Option 2: As Reusable Prompts in VS Code 1.100+

1. Open VS Code 1.100+
2. Go to Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)
3. Select "Chat: Create New Reusable Prompt"

2. Add the desired prompt template
3. Configure the prompt file header with appropriate mode and tools
4. Execute it directly from the file or integrate into your workflows

For more detailed guidance on creating and working with SVG graphics, refer to our [Professional SVG Graphics Guide](../professional_svg_graphics_guide.md).

For information on how to integrate these prompts with custom instructions and workflow automation, see the [Custom Instructions Guide](../custom_instructions_guide.md) and [Instruction & Prompt Files Guide](../instruction_prompt_files_guide.md).

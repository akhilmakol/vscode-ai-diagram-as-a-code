This file contains reusable prompts for creating Gantt charts in Mermaid syntax. Copy these prompts and add them to your VS Code Reusable Prompts collection.

## Basic Project Timeline

```
Create a Mermaid Gantt chart for a [project name] project with the following tasks:
[list tasks with estimated duration]. The project starts on [start date].
Group tasks by project phase. Include dependencies between tasks.
Add milestones for key deliverables.
```

## Software Release Planning

```
Generate a Mermaid Gantt chart for a software release plan for [product name].
Include these phases: Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment.
For each phase, include specific tasks with their durations and dependencies.
Set the project start date to [start date]. Add milestones for feature freeze,
code freeze, and release date. Use color coding to indicate task status or priority.
```

## Sprint Planning Gantt

```
Create a Mermaid Gantt chart for a [number]-week sprint starting on [start date].
Include these user stories and tasks: [list stories/tasks with point estimates].
Convert story points to days using the team velocity. Show which team member is
assigned to each task using different colors. Include daily standups and sprint
ceremonies (planning, review, retrospective). Add a milestone for sprint completion.
```

## Resource Allocation Gantt

```
Generate a Mermaid Gantt chart showing resource allocation for [team/department name]
over the next [timeframe]. Include all team members and their assigned projects/tasks.
Show task durations and any overlaps in assignments. Use color coding to indicate
different project categories or priorities. Highlight periods of potential resource
constraints or overallocation.
```

## Product Roadmap Gantt

```
Create a Mermaid Gantt chart showing a high-level product roadmap for [product name]
over the next [timeframe]. Include major releases, feature sets, and strategic initiatives.
Use quarters or months as time units. Group items by strategic themes or objectives.
Add milestones for key business events or deadlines. Use color coding to distinguish
between committed items and tentative plans.
```

## Infrastructure Upgrade Gantt

```
Generate a Mermaid Gantt chart for an infrastructure upgrade project for [system name].
Include tasks for planning, procurement, setup, migration, testing, and cutover.
Show dependencies between tasks and critical path items. Include maintenance windows
or scheduled downtime periods. Add tasks for pre- and post-implementation verification.
Include milestones for completion of major phases.
```

## Multi-Team Coordination Gantt

```
Create a Mermaid Gantt chart showing coordination between multiple teams for a
[project name] initiative. Include workstreams for each team: [list teams].
Show dependencies between teams' deliverables. Highlight integration points
and handoffs. Use color coding to distinguish different teams. Include joint
milestones where teams must synchronize. Show any shared resources or constraints.
```

## Event Planning Gantt

```
Generate a Mermaid Gantt chart for planning a [event type] event on [event date].
Include all preparation tasks starting [timeframe] before the event. Group tasks by
categories like venue, speakers, marketing, logistics. Show dependencies between
tasks and critical deadlines. Include responsible parties for key tasks. Add
milestones for important decisions or commitments.
```

## Product Launch Gantt

```
Create a Mermaid Gantt chart for a product launch of [product name] on [launch date].
Include all pre-launch activities across departments: product development, marketing,
sales, customer support. Show task dependencies and critical path. Include go/no-go
decision points. Add milestones for key deliverables. Use color coding to indicate
task status or department ownership.
```

## Maintenance Schedule Gantt

```
Generate a Mermaid Gantt chart showing the maintenance schedule for [system/equipment name]
over [timeframe]. Include regular maintenance tasks with their frequencies and durations.
Show any system downtime required for maintenance. Include preparation and verification
tasks. Use color coding to indicate maintenance criticality or impact. Add exclusion
periods for business-critical times when maintenance should be avoided.

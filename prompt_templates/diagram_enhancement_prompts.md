# üîÑ Diagram Enhancement Template Prompts

> *A collection of reusable prompts for enhancing and improving existing diagrams*

---

This file contains reusable prompts for enhancing existing diagrams, regardless of type. These prompts help you improve diagram readability, styling, organization, and documentation. Copy these prompts and add them to your VS Code Reusable Prompts collection.

## Apply Professional Styling

```
Apply professional styling to this basic diagram:

[paste your diagram here]

Enhance it with:
- A consistent color scheme (use primary=#4a6ebf, secondary=#6b7280, highlight=#f0f5ff)
- Improved node shapes appropriate to their function
- Visual grouping of related elements using subgraphs
- Better spacing and layout
- A legend explaining the color coding and symbols
- Clear directional flow (left-to-right or top-to-bottom)

Preserve all existing elements and relationships, just improve the visual presentation.
```

## Add Detailed Documentation

```
Add comprehensive documentation to this diagram:

[paste your diagram here]

Enhance it with:
- Descriptive title as a comment at the top
- Brief overview of the diagram's purpose
- Comments explaining complex sections or decisions
- Notes for important components or interactions
- Version information and last updated date
- Links to related documentation (placeholder URLs are fine)
- Any assumptions or constraints that apply to the diagram

Preserve the diagram's structure and functionality while adding these documentation elements.
```

## Optimize for Readability

```
Optimize this diagram for readability:

[paste your diagram here]

Make these improvements:
- Reorganize elements to minimize line crossings
- Standardize and clarify node labels
- Group related components with subgraphs or visual boundaries
- Simplify complex relationships while preserving meaning
- Improve the visual hierarchy to emphasize important elements
- Break very large diagrams into logical sections
- Add whitespace where appropriate for visual separation

Focus on making the diagram easier to understand at a glance without changing its meaning.
```

## Add Interactive Elements

```
Add interactive enhancements to this diagram:

[paste your diagram here]

Include these interactive elements (using Mermaid's capabilities):
- Clickable links on key components that could lead to more information
- Hover text for complex elements to provide additional context
- Collapsible sections for detailed subcomponents
- Visual emphasis for the active/current state or component
- Highlights for the critical path or main flow

Make sure all additions follow Mermaid syntax requirements and would render correctly.
```

## Convert to Dark Theme

```
Convert this diagram to an aesthetically pleasing dark theme:

[paste your diagram here]

Apply these dark theme styling changes:
- Background color: #1e1e1e or #2d2d2d
- Text color: #f0f0f0 or #e0e0e0
- Primary element color: #4a6ebf (medium blue)
- Secondary element color: #6b7280 (gray)
- Accent color: #9580ff (light purple) for highlights
- Success/positive color: #4caf50 (green)
- Warning/caution color: #ff9800 (orange)
- Error/negative color: #f44336 (red)
- Ensure sufficient contrast between all elements
- Add subtle borders to improve element distinction

Maintain the exact same structure and information, just convert the visual style.
```

## Add Performance Annotations

```
Add performance annotations to this system diagram:

[paste your diagram here]

Enhance it with these performance-related annotations:
- Estimated response time for key operations
- Throughput capabilities on critical paths
- Potential bottlenecks (mark with warning symbol)
- Resource requirements for major components
- Scaling characteristics (vertical vs horizontal)
- Caching mechanisms and their impact
- Areas with known performance optimizations
- Latency between distributed components

Use notes, labels, or color coding to add this information without cluttering the diagram.
```

## Simplify Complex Diagram

```
Simplify this complex diagram while preserving its essential meaning:

[paste your diagram here]

Apply these simplification techniques:
- Consolidate related components into higher-level abstractions
- Remove excessive detail that doesn't add critical understanding
- Group related elements into logical subgraphs
- Highlight the most important flows or relationships
- Abstract away implementation details to focus on concepts
- Create a clearer visual hierarchy
- Add notes to explain simplified areas

Ensure that the simplified diagram still accurately represents the system but is much easier to comprehend quickly.
```

## Add Security Annotations

```
Add security annotations to this system diagram:

[paste your diagram here]

Enhance it with these security-related annotations:
- Trust boundaries between components (dotted lines or boundaries)
- Authentication and authorization checkpoints
- Data classification levels for storage or transmission
- Encryption requirements for data in transit
- Access control mechanisms
- Audit/logging points
- Potential security vulnerabilities (marked discretely)
- Compliance requirements for specific components

Use notes, boundary markers, or subtle color coding to add this information clearly but without overwhelming the diagram.
```

## Convert to Presentation-Ready Format

```
Transform this technical diagram into a presentation-ready format:

[paste your diagram here]

Make these presentation-friendly improvements:
- Add a clear, descriptive title
- Include a brief caption or description
- Simplify technical jargon for a broader audience
- Highlight the key points that need attention
- Use a visually appealing color scheme
- Add numbers or sequence indicators for walking through the diagram
- Include summary notes that explain the diagram's significance
- Ensure all text is large enough to be readable in a presentation

The result should be suitable for inclusion in slides or an executive presentation.
```

## Add Versioning Annotations

```
Add versioning and timeline annotations to this system diagram:

[paste your diagram here]

Enhance it with these versioning elements:
- Current system state clearly marked
- Planned future components (marked differently)
- Deprecating or legacy components (marked for removal)
- Version or timeline information for key components
- Migration paths between old and new elements
- Phase indicators for multi-stage implementations
- Dependencies between components that affect upgrade sequence
- Compatibility requirements between different versions

Use color coding, styles, or notes to clearly distinguish between current, future, and legacy elements.

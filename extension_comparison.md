## Key Considerations When Choosing an Extension

1. **Type of diagrams needed**: Match the extension to your visualization requirements
2. **Technical expertise**: Some extensions require more coding knowledge than others
3. **Integration requirements**: Consider how the diagrams will be shared and published
4. **Collaboration needs**: Some extensions better support team workflows
5. **AI assistance level**: Different extensions offer varying levels of AI integration

## Best Practices for Using AI with Graphics Extensions

1. **Start with clear descriptions**: Provide detailed prompts about what you want to visualize
2. **Iterative refinement**: Use AI to generate initial diagrams, then refine manually
3. **Learn from AI-generated code**: Study the patterns in AI-generated diagram code to improve your skills
4. **Combine approaches**: Use AI for complex structure, then enhance with manual tools
5. **Validate accuracy**: Always verify that AI-generated diagrams correctly represent your intended concepts

## Future Trends

As AI continues to evolve, we can expect:

- More sophisticated natural language understanding for diagram generation
- Real-time collaborative diagramming with AI assistance
- Automatic conversion between different diagram types
- AI that can suggest improvements to diagram clarity and aesthetics
- Code-to-diagram and diagram-to-code bidirectional transformations
